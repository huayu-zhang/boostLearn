Living in the middle of Berlin-WEST in the mostly gay area I appreciate the many different possibilities one has to enjoy the city and the security here.
I'm in for culture for all sorts, knowledge of the city and its history. And of course travelling.
I'm very communicative and like to tell people everything about Berlin and travel-experiences. 
I am also very curious about other people's culture and opinion of life, so please be communicative too about yourself. :-)

","I'm a creative person, adventurer, and traveler and always looking forward to my next trip! I love beaches, palm trees and out of the way places. 
Morocco, Portugal and Spain have become my favorite destinations and I prefer staying with local people so I really have a chance to learn about the area I am visiting. 
I am easy going and love making new friends! I love Yoga and fitness. I enjoy mindful and easy conversation and like to stretch a point.
I speak English, a little Spanish and a little French but found that communication is never a big problem as long as you trust in speaking gestures.
As one of the most experienced Airbnb Superhosts in Berlin I know how to be a mindful guest.
When I am at home and slip into the role of a host I am looking forward to welcoming you in my guestroom here in Prenzlauer Berg.
